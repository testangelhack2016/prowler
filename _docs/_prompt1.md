### Prompt: Architecting a 10x solution


You are a Principal Architect tasked with designing a "10x" version of a Security Auditing solution. Your goal is to move beyond traditional configuration scanning and create a platform that is intelligent, proactive, and understands risk in the context of a real-world environment.

To guide your thinking, use the following "FROM/TO" shifts. For each one, answer the critical "How Might We..." questions to define the new architecture.

1. FROM a Static Checklist... TO a Dynamic Risk Graph

A flat list of findings is noise. The 10x solution understands relationships.

How Might We represent the entire cloud environment (resources, identities, permissions, network paths) as a single, queryable graph?
How Might We use this graph to discover "attack paths"—toxic combinations of low-risk misconfigurations that create a high-risk exploit chain (e.g., a public VM with a role that can access a private database)?
2. FROM Reactive Findings... TO Proactive, Autonomous Remediation

Finding a problem is only 10% of the work. The 10x solution actively fixes problems.

How Might We use AI/LLMs to automatically generate a validated Infrastructure as Code (IaC) pull request (e.g., in Terraform or CloudFormation) that fixes the detected misconfiguration?
How Might We design a safety and governance model that allows for certain classes of vulnerabilities to be remediated autonomously with zero human intervention?
3. FROM Configuration Checks... TO Behavioral Anomaly Detection

A perfectly configured system can still be compromised. The 10x solution spots unusual activity.

How Might We ingest and analyze streams of activity logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, GCP Audit Logs) in real-time?
How Might We define what "normal" behavior looks like for a given role or resource and automatically flag deviations as potential threats (e.g., an application role suddenly trying to create new IAM users)?
4. FROM Technical Findings... TO Business-Context-Aware Prioritization

Not all assets are created equal. The 10x solution knows what matters most to the business.

How Might We allow users to define their business context, such as tagging critical applications, specifying compliance goals (SOC 2, GDPR), or identifying sensitive data stores?
How Might We use this context to automatically elevate the priority of a finding? For example, treat "public S3 bucket" as a CRITICAL alert if it's tagged contains: pii, but as a MEDIUM alert if it's tagged app: public-website-assets.
Based on your answers to the questions above, produce the following:

A High-Level Architecture Diagram: Sketch a new mermaidjs diagram that shows the key components of this 10x system (e.g., "Graph Ingestion Service," "Attack Path Engine," "AI Remediation Service," "Behavioral Analysis Engine").
A Narrative Description: Write a short paragraph explaining how a finding (e.g., an overly permissive IAM role) is processed through this new architecture, from detection to its final, prioritized, and remediated state.
